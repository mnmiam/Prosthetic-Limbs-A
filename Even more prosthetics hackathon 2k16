            <p><ol><li>The biggest issue with today's prosthetics is the high cost as they are very expensive and many in need are unable to afford it
              <li> It is well known that today's prosthetics tend to cause skin irritations and rashes. They may also require additional surgeries which firthermore add to the cost.
                <li>Another issue with the today's world of prosthetics is the time necessary to both adjust to the prosthetics and getting them on and off for specific times.(such as sleeping when you don't want your prosthetic to get stuck on a blanket or sheet.
                  <li>The current solution to solve some issues regarding the time necessary is only making matters worse. They are cheaply creating apps in the arm to improve grip and stability. However, these apps can be hacked more simply than our prosthetic which could lead to the entire arm being hacked. 
                    <li> One of the less discussed issues is that the current prosthetics on the market tend to slip, loosen or just fall off. A prime example of this concern comes from Heather Mills (former spouse of Paul McCartney). She was participating on the TV show, "Dancing on Ice" when her prosthetic leg flew off mid-routine. </p>

<br>We have created a new kind of prosthetics; but these aren't just any prosthetics, these prosthetics directly connect to the peripheral nerrvous system which connects the brain to the spinal cord, to the rest of the body. So, by connecting these prosthetics to the peripheral nervous system, whatever your brain thinks (in regard to movement of the limb) is how the limb will move.
<em> For example, if you have one of our innovate prosthetic limbs, lets say a leg for instance and you want to walk forward. All of you have to do is somewhere in your brain have a thought about walking; so, if you want to walk forward, you'll walk forward with no issue.</em>
